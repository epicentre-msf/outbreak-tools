[Quickly build a linelist from an excel dictionary]{.h1}

**OutbreakTools** is a set of solutions designed by [Epicentre](https://epicentre.msf.org/) [EpiDS team](https://apps.epicentre-msf.org/public/) to quickly create linelists to collect field data during outbreaks without relying on fancy VBA skills. These linelists have a number of functionalities including descriptive analyses, buttons to migrate data to or from the linelist, or to import geographic data to better describe locations.

[Documentation]{.h1}

This site contains documentation both on how to develop and modify an OBT linelist, and how to use it.
