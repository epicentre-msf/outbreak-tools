## Time series

### Table 1

Defines the tables (organise them in sections, which temporal variable, which grouping variable if any, title, summarising formula etc.
)

### Table 2: graph metadata

This table table is used to define the title and order of the graphs associated with the time series.


| Column      | Type      | Mandatory | Details     |
|-------------|-----------|:---------:|-------------|
| Graph title | Free text |    Yes    | Short title |
| Graph order | Free text |    Yes    |             |
| Graph ID    | Automatic |    Yes    |             |



### Table 3: define the graph

This table defines the graphs. It imports a lot of information from the two other tables.
One graph can plot several series. A series is a *column* in a time series table.

Example: a graph plotting the number of "Cured" and "Dead" across time is plotting *two series*, the number of cured and the number of dead, which were obtained from one table where the `exit_status` was used as grouping variable.

### Summary

![](../images/im-080-diagram.png){fig-align="center"}


## Some functions/examples

### In the global summary

`DATE_RANGE` is a custom funtion to display the min and max of a date variable. Example: `DATE_RANGE(visit_date)`.

`COUNTA(case_id)`: counts the number of non empty case_id.

`COUNTIF(hospit_yn, "Yes")` counts the number of *Yes* in the `hospit_yn` variable


### Count rows

`N`: count the number of rows for each modality of a variable. The setup user defines for each analysis whether the empty cells should be added in the table (as their own categories).


### Calculate a CFR

`SUM(cfr_numerator) / SUM(cfr_denominator)` to calculate a Case Fatality Rate. 
- The `cfr_numerator` is a calculated variable  based on the outcome column; it takes 1 for deceased patient and zero for others. 
- The `cfr_denominator` is also a calculated column, which takes 1 for discharged patients and 0 for other patients.

Don't forget to pick a percent format with appropriate rounding level.

### Spatial analyses or spatio-temporal analyses

For the top ten (or whichever value you chose) areas with the most cases, use `N` as the function summary.
 For the top ten areas for the number of deaths, use `SUM(is_dead_01)` where `is_dead_01` here is a calculated variable that takes 1 if the patient is dead and 0 otherwhise.
