## Categorical and calculated variables

OutbreakTools allows both **input variables** in which the user enters data and **calculated variables** derived from the raw data.

When it comes to **text input** variables, there are two primary methods for data entry: 

- a *free text* approach, allowing users to input any value they choose, 
- a *controlled* approach, where user options are restricted. 

In Excel, the controlled approach for text variables is typically implemented with **dropdown menus**, which allow data entry of pre-defined categories. OutbreakTools offers multiple ways to create dropdown menus, depending on whether you have predefined categories or not. 

The columns [Control](../reference/dictionary_sheet.qmd#sec-var-control) together with [Control details](../reference/dictionary_sheet.qmd#sec-var-control-details) are use to constrain the values that a text variable can take, or provide with a formula in the case of a calculated variable.

: Summary of the types of control available in OutbreakTools

::: {.callout-note}
If no control is selected, the text variable is free text.
:::

::: {.callout-note}
The variables that contain geographic information are treated as a special case of categorical variable and have their own [dedicated control](../reference/dictionary_sheet.qmd#sec-geo-data).
:::


::: {.callout-note}
For non text variable (integers, decimals, dates) is is possible to restrict values using [data validation](../reference/dictionary_sheet.qmd#sec-data-validation)
