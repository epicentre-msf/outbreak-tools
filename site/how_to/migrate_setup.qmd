3. Select what to import from the original by ticking the boxes. If you are doing a standard **setup file** upgrade, you should tick all the boxes to iport everything.
4. Decide if you want to run a checkup of the **setup** file after import by ticking the box or not (you probably want to, but you can also [do it](../reference/ribbons_setup.qmd#sec-check-setup) at a later stage)
5. Click on the "Import" button and wait.
