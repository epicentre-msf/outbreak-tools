## Download the OutbreakTools archive ðŸ“¦ {#sec-download}

Save the archive locally on your computer and unzip it.



## Install the OubreakTools files {#sec-obt-files}

The solution is based on VBA scripts in Excel files, so there is nothing to install.

You should however [authorise VBA macros in Excel](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/office/enable-or-disable-macros-in-microsoft-365-files-12b036fd-d140-4e74-b45e-16fed1a7e5c6) so that the files work as expected (or at all, in fact).

The archive contains several timestamped files:

- `setup-YYYY-MM-DD.xlsb`: an empty **setup file**
- `designer_main-YYYY-MM-DD.xlsb`: the **designer file** that is used to compile the setup
- `_ribbontemplate_main-YYYY-MM-DD.xlsb`: a template file containing information used during compilation
- `run_designer_on_windows.R` and `rundesigner.vbs`: files that can be used to compile from R (experimental and yet undocumented)

:::{.callout-note}
The excel files are in the `.xlsb` format, a compressed, more efficient Excel format that allows VBA macros.

## Update to a new version of OutbreakTools

The OutbreakTools solution is in active development, so there are regular updates to the files, to add new functionalities or correct bugs. To upgrade, just [dowload the tools](https://github.com/epicentre-msf/outbreak-tools) again and use the new **setup** and **designer**. If you already have a working setup for a linelist, it is possible to [migrate](../how_to/migrate_setup.qmd) its content to a new empty **setup file**.
