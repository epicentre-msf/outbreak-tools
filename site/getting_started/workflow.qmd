## Workflow

Follow these steps to create a linelist with OutbreakTools:

1.  Fill a **setup file** to define linelist specs
2.  Compile the **setup file** using the **designer file**
3.  Test the created linelist
4.  Correct bugs in the **setup file**
5.  Rinse and repeat until the linelist is functional

## Setup file

The **setup file** is an excel file that describes the various sheets of the linelist to be created, in a *predefined* and *standardised* format. It allows you to specify:

-   the structure of the data entry sheets of the linelist
-   the variables for all data entry tables
-   the basic analyses to be included in the linelist (uni and bivarites, epicurves, geo data etc.)
-   personalised exports
-   translations to create linelists in several languages

Most of the work developing a linelist is spent filling a **setup file** template to define all the aspects of the linelist you want to create.

The setup file contains the following sheets:

| Setup file sheet | Description                                                                                                                                                                                  | Correspondence in linelist file                                   |
|--------------|--------------------------------------------|--------------|
| Dictionary       | Describes all the variables to be collected, their format, etc.                                                                                                                              | Data entry sheets (typically, *Info sheet* and *Linelist* sheets) |
| Choices          | Defines the categories/levels accepted for categorical variables, in the form of a list                                                                                                      | Dropdown menus in linelist sheets                                 |
| Exports          | Defines the characteristics of exports, such as protection, choice of variables or sheets to export and export names                                                                         | Export button in the OutbreakTools ribbon                         |
| Analyses         | Describes the analyses to include is the linelist in tabular form, by selecting the variables and indicating the formulas to be applied                                                      | Analysis sheets                                                   |
| Translation      | Automatically displays the list of strings of text/fields to be translated and adds new columns where the user can provide translated text in a desired language (one column = one language) | Choice of linelist language when created (designer)               |

: Sheets in the **setup file** and their uses.

The **setup file** has a dedicated OutbreakTools section in the top option ribbon from Excel:

Go to the [reference](../reference/ribbons_setup.qmd) to know more about the ribbon buttons.



## Designer file

The **designer** is another excel file, that contains the code to build a linelist from a **setup file**.

When the **setup file** is ready (or at least a first draft is), you load it into a **designer**, fill a couple of fields[^1] and let the designer build the linelist.

[^1]: What is the name of the created linelist, where to save it, should it be password protected and if yes, which password etc.

The **designer file** also has a dedicated OutbreakTools section in the top option ribbon from Excel:

## Linelist

The linelists created from a compiled **setup file** will contain several sheets:

-   Data entry sheets
-   Analysis and graph sheets\
-   Customisation sheets for custom drop-down menus and the geographic base

In addition to that, the OBT linelists also have a dedicated **OutbreakTools ribbon** in addition to the other excel options in the top ribbon.
