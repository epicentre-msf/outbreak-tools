This sheet is used to define the **dropdown menus categories** to be used for categorical variables, or the possible values for "choice_formula" type variables. 

## Rules

- a *list* is made of several consecutive lines  
- a *line* represents one value of a given list, and correspond to one item of the associated dropdown menu  
- different lists are written one below the other  
- you can define as many lists as needed

## List Name

This is a free text field used to define a dropdown list. Lines with the same *name* filled belong to the same list. This name is used in the *Dictionary* sheet to identify the dropdown list to be used for a given variable, in the [Control details](../reference/dictionary_sheet.qmd#sec-var-control-details) column.

## Naming lists

It is not mandatory, but we advise that you begin all your list names by "list_" to easily separate them from variable names in the dictionary.

With the exception of lists used for "choice_custom" type variables, it is recommended not to leave any blanks in the list name. Instead, replace them with "\_", for example.

## Ordering list

This is a free text field. Fill in integers to define the order in which the options are displayed in the dropdown menu.


## Label

This is a free text field used to list the different values to be displayed in the dropdown menus.

::: {.callout-warning}
Categories names should not begin with a "\<" or a "\>".

## Short label

This is a free text field in which you can enter a shortened version of the label, to be used in the Case Report Form generation tool in the linelist, to make the CRF more condensed.

## Example
