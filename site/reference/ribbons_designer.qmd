## Manage the designer

### Clear the geobase

Remove any geobase that was loaded in the designer.

### Clear entries

Remove all user entered data from fields.

### Language of the designer

Use the dropdown menu to change the language of the designer interface. Available languages: English, French, Arabic, Spanish and Portuguese. 



## Imports

### Import translations

If the user wishes to modify the linelist interface translations, it is possible to ask for the config file to EpiDS/Yves Amevoin, tweak it and import it with this button.

### Import passwords

The designer is loaded with a pasword table, with private and public keys to protect export if the user want a password-protected export. However, the designer is on Github, in a public repo, so if you compile a linelist that needs a password protection, it is best to ask for the config file to EpiDS/Yves Amevoin and import it using the "Import button".

### Import styles {#sec-setup-styles}

The designer comes with two default styles for linelist themes. It is possible to personalise it. To do that, ask for the config file to EpiDS/Yves Amevoin, tweak it and import it with this button.
