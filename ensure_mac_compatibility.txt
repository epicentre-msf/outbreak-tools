- Reduce the screen flickering when opening a workbook (find a way to hide it)
- Solve the problem related to validation when the window is minimized (and/ or test it)
- Avoid moving between windows when copying a worksheet
- Split the panes for a sheet of type linelist
- Seems like the application.international(xllistseparator) is not working
when dealing with workbook only (try to find why.)
