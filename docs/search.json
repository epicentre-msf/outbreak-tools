The blue pieces are vlist1D variables that were defined for that linelist (in the Info sheet, hence their suffixes).\nThis name specification will result in the following export names, depending on where the linelist is used (hence depending on how they filled the metadata):\n\nMNG_linelist__MNG24__SSD__MSF-OCP__Aweil__anonyme__vb-1003__20240617-1901.xlsb if the linelist was used by OCP in Aweil (South Sudan)\nMNG_linelist__MNG24__NER__WaCa__Maradi__anonyme__vb-2035__20240617-1903.xlsb if the linelist was used by WaCa in Maradi (Niger)\n…\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nIf a variable is referred to in the name but remains empty in the linelist, the name of the variable is used as a placeholder. In the example above, if the data encoder filled none of the variables in the metadata, the created file would have the following name:\nMNG_linelist__info_outbreak_code__info_country_code__info_organisation__info_facility_name__anonyme__vb-1003__20240617-1906.xlsb"

By opposition, variable labels can change or be translated.\nVariable names are used to migrate data from one linelist file to the other: changing the variable name of a variable in the setup is equivalent to creating a new variable: the migration script will not be able to match the variables.\n\n\nVariable names rules:\n\nNames must be unique in the setup file, even if the variables are on different sheets.\n\nNames must be at least 4 characters long to be valid.\n\nNames should not contain special characters (except for “_”).\n\nNames will be automatically converted to lower-case during compilation.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nAs a general advice, try to create short but explicit names (easier said than done).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNames must be made unique\n\n\n\nTo ensure that variable names are unique, you can add the name of the sheet in which the variable will appear as a prefix, or use numbers.\nIf by error two or more variables have the same name, the second occurrence will automatically be suffixed with the value “1”; if there is a third, it will be suffixed with the value “2”, and so on.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nWe recommend that you do not leave any blanks in the variable name. Instead, replace them with “_”.\n\n\n\n\nMain Label\nThis is a free text field that defines the variables labels, which are quick descriptions of the variables, which the linelist user can read. They are typically more descriptive and longer than names, but we recommend to keep them moderately short for legibility reasons.\nIn the linelist, the main label appears in black and bold. It cannot be modified by the end user (with the exception of explicitly editable labels.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip: add more information\n\n\n\n\n\nTo add more details, you can use the following fields: Sub Label and Note.\n\n\n\n\n\nDev Comment\nThis free text column is for the sole benefit of the setup file developer (in all probability, you), to add technical or practical information. It is not read by the designer and does not affect the generated file.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip: Example of one user usage\n\n\n\n\n\nOne of the author of this doc uses these tags:\n\nFormat: calculated columns created for applying conditional formatting. These columns are very specific, and pure format. Tagging them helps to quickly make sure that they are never exported\nMoH: columns created when a general setup is adapted to a specific MoH format by adding a dedicated export for that format. Usually, we need to create some calculated columns that match the MoH export (recoding levels, or perhaps merging information of several variables…). I like to keep track of which columns are from the general setup and which are specific adaptations.\nWHO/Epinetwork: sometimes I want to keep the information that a column is here because it comes from the Epinetwork or the WHO CRF, and should probably not be modified.\nBoilerplate: calculated columns that are needed for graphs, or because the information is important (such as epiweeks). These columns are often hidden, but not necessarily, and they sometimes can be exported too.\n\n\n\n\nFeel free to use this column in a ways that helps you work, or to ignore it!\n\n\nEditable Label\nThis is a yes/no column. If the value is “yes”, the label of the variable in the linelist can be modified by its user. If the value is “no” or if the field remains empty, the variable label in the linelist is protected.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip: add customisable variables in your linelists\n\n\n\nIt is often desirable to add a couple of columns with editable labels at the end of the linelist, in case the user want to collect some extra information. It gives some freedom to users to collect some site specific data without needing an update of the setup. When I do that, I usually provide a couple of free text variables, and a couple of customisable dropdowns variables\n\n\n\n\nSub Label\nThis is a free text field used to add a brief description under the variable label, such as the format in which a date is expected, a unit, or any other information to help with filling the variable in.\nIn the linelist, the sub-label appears just below the main label, in blue and slightly smaller font. It cannot be modified by the end user.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nThe sub-labels “Calculated” and “Custom dropdown” are added automatically, no need to add them manually.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip: example of common sub-labels\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYes / No\nYes / No / Unk.\nFree text\nThe format of your date (ex: DD/MM/YYYY)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\nThis is a free text field which content is added to the linelist as a comment on the corresponding cell. The comment in the linelist can be read by hovering the cursor over the cell. It cannot be modified by the end user.\n\n\nExample\nDefinitions in the setup file:\n\n\n\n\n\nDisplay in the linelist file:"

There are two options:\n\nvlist1D: corresponds to a table built Vertically, so the variables labels are in the same column, and only one entry is expected for each variable. This structure of data is well adapted to collect metadata about the health structure, the project or the data collection itself.\nhlist2D: corresponds to a table built Horizontally, so the variables labels appear in the same row, and several entries are possible for each variable.

This makes it possible to group variables by theme to make data entry and navigation easier.\nIn the linelist file, the main sections appear in a darker colour in rows or columns, depending on the type of table (dark blue in the example). They cannot be modified by the end user.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip: organise variables\n\n\n\nTo make the dictionary easier to read, we recommend that you group (write one below another) the variables of a same sheet and a same section.\n\n\n\n\nSub Section\nThis is a free text field that allows you to further refine the organisation of variables in the table by creating a second level of grouping.\nIn the linelist file, the sub-sections appear in a lighter colour in the row or column, depending on the type of table (light blue in the example).

    "text": "Properties\nThe properties section of the table controls variable visibility, uniqueness, and the type and format of the variable (what it contains, in which form, and in which display).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStatus\nThis is a dropdown field that contains four options for defining the visibility of the variable. The linelist has a functionality to show or hide optional variables depending on the data needs on the field.\n\nmandatory: variable displayed by default, it cannot be hidden in the linelist\noptional, visible: variable displayed by default, it can be displayed or hidden by the linelist user\noptional, hidden: variable hidden by default, it can be displayed or hidden by the linelist user\nhidden: variable hidden by default, it cannot be displayed in the linelist\n\nVariables can be shown or hidden using the “Show/Hide” button of the linelist OutbreakTools menu in the linelist file. See the how to.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote on showing and hiding columns manually\n\n\n\n\n\nTechnically, the linelist user can forcefully hide/un-hide columns.\nUn-hiding hidden (usually calculated) columns is usually desirable during linelist debug or to go check data that may interest you (e.g. a hidden calculated epiweek of exit). You can hide them after consultation without consequences on the rest of the linelist.\nIt is however more dangerous to forcefully hide “mandatory” columns. These columns are often fundamental variables in the linelist, that are needed for data understanding and analyses (e.g. date of admission, age or sex). If you choose to hide one of these columns, know that some analyses might not function as expected, or not at all because they rely on the hidden columns.\nFinally, any change of column visibility that is not made via the “Hide/show variable” button of the linelist will not be recorded and migrated to a new linelist.\n\n\n\n\nExample\nDefinition in the setup file:\n\nDisplay in the linelist file:\n\n\n\n\n\nRegister Book\nThis is a yes/no dropdown menu field used to predefine the variables to be included in the register to be printed. This step is not mandatory and can be managed later, directly in the linelist file.\n\n\nPersonal Identifier\nThis is a yes/no dropdown menu field that indicates that the variable contains personal data (such as names, phone numbers etc.).\nThis column has two uses:\n\nit allows the setup developer to quickly identify variables containing personal data in its dictionary\nit is used to remove variables automatically from the exports if such a behaviour is needed (see the Exports sheet).\n\n\n\nThinking about variables\nThere are many ways of thinking about variables and of classifying them.\nIn general we can distinguished between input variables, where the user enters raw data, and calculated (or derived) variables which require no input. Both of them can be created in OutbreakTools.\nIndependently of this distinction, a variety of variables types can exist, containing numbers or text in various forms. In Excel, we will often use the types integer, decimals, dates and text.1. These types are implemented in OutbreakTools linelists.\nFor input variables, you could think of two ways of entering data: a free text approach, where user can enter the value of their choice, and a controlled (constrained) approach, where the values the user can enter are limited. In Excel, this is generally implemented through dropdown menus from which the data encoder selects a value. In OutbreakTools, there have several ways of building dropdown menus, depending on whether you know the categories in advance or not. This is what we call variable control.\nFinally, many softwares allow the user to set the way the data is displayed, which we here call variable format. For example:\n\nThe date first of January of 2023 can be displayed as “01/01/2024”, or “1/1/24” or 1-Jan-24” etc.\n\nThe number “1” could be displayed as “1” simply, or “001”\n\nThe number 0.01 could be displayed with different levels of rounding, or even as “10%” if the column contains proportions that can be displayed as percentages.\n\n\n\nVariable Type\nThis column proposes a dropdown menu field containing four options for defining the type2 of each variable:\n\nText: creates a column of text3. The entry of the text may be free or constrained by a dropdown menu.\nDate: creates a date column, whose exact format is defined in the Variable format column. The default format is jj-mmm-aaaa.\nInteger: creates an integer column\nDecimal: creates a column with decimal numbers. The number of digits after the decimal point is defined in the Variable format.\n\n\n\n\nVariable Format\nThis field is used to specify the format of the variable (which depends on its type).\nThere is a predefined dropdown list with common options, but you can enter any format by hand, as long as it is written in Excel syntax (see here and here for information).\n\nExample: for an integer to appear with at least 2 characters, enter the format: # #00\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nNote that the default date format is jj-mmm-aaaa.\n\n\n\n\nControl\nThis is a dropdown field containing nine options for defining variables that are not free text:\n\nchoice_manual\nchoice_custom\nchoice_multiple\nlist_auto\ngeo\nhf\nformula\ncase_when\nchoice_formula\n\nThese options broadly correspond to two sorts of variables to be created:\n\ninput categorical variables with constrained values and filled via a dropdown menu\n\ncalculated variables\n\nIn OutbreakTools, the variables to fill in geographic information are treated as a special case of categorical variable and have their own dedicated control.\n\nSummary of the types of control available in OutbreakTools\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSort of variable\nControls\nData entry in the linelist\n\n\n\n\nCategorical\nchoice_manual, choice_custom, choice_multiple, list_auto\nDropdown menu\n\n\nGeo-related columns (a special case of categorical)\ngeo, hf\nGeoHelper or dropdown menu\n\n\nCalculated\nformula, choice_formula, case_when\nNo user input needed in these columns\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGuide to choosing variable control in OBT\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote on data validation\n\n\n\nFor non-text variable (integers, decimals, dates) is is possible to restrict values using data validation\n\n\n\nDropdown menu variables\nThis table summarises the different options:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nControl\nHow to populate the dropdown menu\nWhere are values defined?\nData entry\n\n\n\n\nchoice_manual\nPredefined values\nIn the setup file, in the Choices sheet\nOne value selected from a dropdown menu\n\n\nchoice_multiple\nPredefined values\nIn the setup file, in the Choices sheet\nSeveral values selected from a dropdown menu\n\n\nchoice_custom\nUser-defined values (but see details)\nIn the Linelist file, in the Custom dropdown sheet\nOne value selected from a dropdown menu\n\n\nlist_auto\nUser-defined values but from another data column\nIn the Linelist file, in another column\nOne value selected from a dropdown menu populated by the values of another variable\n\n\n\n\nchoice_manual\nThis control creates a categorical variable with a static dropdown menu in the linelist, from which one value can be selected. The authorised values from the dropdown menu are defined in advance in the setup and cannot be modified by the users of the linelist (hence the “static” description).\nIn the setup file, we define these values in a list stored in the Choices sheet, and fill the name of that list in the Control details column.\n\n\nchoice_multiple\nThis control is similar to the “choice_manual” control, in that it creates a static dropdown menu in the linelist from predefined values entered in the setup file.\nThe difference is that in the created linelist, the user can use the dropdown menu several times to select multiple values. These values will be concatenated and stored as a chain of character. By default, the separator is a coma (“,”), but you can modify this in the control column. For example, entering choice_multiple(“_”) will use the character “_” to separate values instead of “,”.\nExample: if the user selects “Azythromicin”, then “Ampicilin” from a dropdown menu, the value “Azythromicin, Ampicilin” will be stored in the cell.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWarning: cannot be used for analyses\n\n\n\nA choice_multiple column cannot be used in the Analyses sheets as the designer cannot predict the number of combinations the user will create, and thus cannot create tables with appropriate size.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip: inform the linelist user\n\n\n\nSince columns allowing multiple choices are rare in linelists in general, we advise you to use the sub-label and possibly a note to inform the linelist user that they can enter several values, and how to do it.\n\n\n\n\nchoice_custom\nThis control creates a dynamic dropdown menu in the linelist, but contrary to the previous controls, the values are not (necessarily) predefined in the setup file, but instead defined by the user. This control is useful for variables where one would like to enforce standardization of values, but the values to encode are not known in advance.\nExample: you wish to create a column containing the name of facilities patients can be transferred to. The names of these facilities is site dependent, thus unknown in advance.\nUsing this control for at least one variable adds a “Custom dropdown sheet in the linelist, where the user can fill-in values to populate the dynamic, customised dropdown menu.\nWhile by default the dropdown menu created is empty, it is possible to pre-fill it by filling the “Control Details” column with a list of choices, like for the other types of dropdowns menus (see the details on setting up dropdown menus below). The table in the Custom dropdown sheet of the linelist will still be created and future users will be able to modify it.\n\n\nlist_auto\nThis control also creates a dynamic dropdown menu, but the values come from the data entered in another column.\nExample: a linelist contains two data-entry sheets:\n\nthe first data entry sheet contains patient data\n\na second data entry sheet contains more variables for a subset of re-admitted patients.\n\nThe “list_auto” control allows to create a column on the second sheet with a dropdown menu populated dynamically with the patient IDs from the first sheet.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the setup file, the variable used to populate the dropdown menu is defined in Control Details.\n\n\n\nSpecial case of administrative levels and health facilities\nTwo controls allow the user of the linelist to enter geographic information, or information about health facilities. While the created variables are technically dropdown menus, they are treated as a special type of variables in OubtbreakTools linelists, with dedicated tools and analyses.\nOutbreakTool linelists all have a button to import a geobase, a standardised file containing lists of administrative levels to describe places. Once the geobase is successfully imported, the values from its lists populate specific dropdown menus.\n\ngeo\nThe “geo” control indicates that geographic data is expected. In the linelist, this results in the creation of four columns, one for each administrative level, which will be populated by values imported from a geobase. The user can enter data by using the GeoHelper button in the linelist or by selecting values from the cascading dropdown menus in the linelist.\nThe “geo” control does not need additional information to be filled in the “Control Details” column.\nIn the linelist, the variable labels appear in orange cells, which means that the “GeoHelper” button can be used to fill in the corresponding cells.\nExample:\nDefinition in the setup file:\n\nDisplay in the linelist file:\n\nDisplay in the linelist file after importing a geobase (here a Nigeria geobase, note the personalisation of the labels):\n\n\n\nhf\nThe “hf” control means that the user will enter health facility names. By identifying hf data in this way, you can use the GeoHelper button in the linelist to fill in the column.\nSimilarly to the “geo” control, the “hf” control does not need additional information to be filled in the “Control Details” column.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nThe variable label appears in an orange cell, which means that the GeoHelper button can be used to fill in the corresponding cells.\n\n\nExample:\nDefinition in the setup file:\n\nDisplay in the linelist:\n\n\n\n\nCalculated variables\nThree controls allow the creation of calculated columns. In general, the user can define a column by providing an Excel formula 4, but the setup file also provides two custom functions, CASE_WHEN and CHOICE_FORMULA to simplify formula syntax.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nControl\nFunctions\nUse\nDefault value\nCan be used in used in analyses tables\n\n\n\n\nformula\nAny combination of Excel functions (in English)\nAnything\n\nContinuous variables: yes Categorical variables: no\n\n\ncase_when\nCASE_WHEN(Excel functions optional)\nReplaces nested Ifs\nEmpty cells; user can modify it\nNo\n\n\nchoice_formula\nCHOICE_FORMULA (Excel functions optional)\nReplaces nested IF\nEmpty character; user cannot modify it\nYes\n\n\n\n\nformula\nWhen using the “formula” control, the value displayed is calculated according to a formula defined in the Control details column of the dictionary.\n\n\ncase_when\nVariables of control “case_when” use a specifically developed function, CASE_WHEN, which replaces a succession of nested IF. While you could write the formula with nested IF, CASE_WHEN is easier to read, thus simpler to use.\nUsercase You want to recode a variable, but you do not know which values will be generated. For example, the raw data contains a columns for the age value and a column for the age unit. You use CASE_WHEN to create a column “age_years”. The values which will be present in the column can take many decimal value in the range of reasonable ages.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportant: CASE_WHEN and analyses\n\n\n\nCategorical variable created with this control cannot be used in univariate or bivariate tables in analyses sheets, because the designer cannot know in advance how many modalities the variable will take, and thus cannot build the tables.\nOn the other hand, numeric variables created with this control (such as age in years) can be summarised in the analyses. Indeed, taking the mean or the median of a numeric variable variable outputs one value, so the designer knows what to expect.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWarning\n\n\n\nTo work properly the “case_when” control must be associated with a CASE_WHENfunction in the Control details column, or the designer will not work properly because the function is not native.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhy not using more recent Excel functions?\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you are using a recent version of Excel, you may know the functions IFS or SWITCH. OutbreakTools does not rely on them as they are not retro-compatible with some older versions of Excel. Use a CASE_WHEN or CHOICE_FORMULA instead.\n\n\n\nRead more about writing the formula in the Control details column below.\n\n\nchoice_formula\nThis control indicates the use of the CHOICE_FORMULA function, another custom function. This function is a special case of the CASE_WHEN formula, with more constrains on it. Indeed, the values that the calculated variable can take are known in advance and predefined in the Choices sheet.\nColumns generated with this control can be used in univariate or bivariate tables, as the number of possible categories is known in advance.\nRead more about writing the formula in the Control details column below.\n\n\n\n\nControl details\nThis is a free text field, which accepts three types of values:\n\nthe name of a list (defined in the Choices sheet),\nthe name of a variable (defined in the Dictionary sheet)\na formula.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nControl type\nControl column\nValue expected in the “Control details” column\n\n\n\n\n\nStatic dropdown menu\nchoice_manual choice_custom choice_multiple\nThe name of a list that contains the authorised values defined in the Choice sheet (“List Name” column)\n\n\n\nDynamic dropdown\nlist_auto\nThe name of an existing variable\n\n\n\nCalculated\nformula case_when choice_formula\nAn Excel formula (that can contain one or | more functions, including the custom | functions CASE_WHEN and CHOICE_FORMULA)\n\n\n\n\nDefining dropdown menu categories\nWhen the controls “choice_manual”, “choice_multiple” (and optionally “choice_custom”) are selected in the Control column, you need to define the values the dropdown menu will contain (i.e. the categories).\nThese values are specified in the Choices sheet. Categories of a same variable are bundled into named lists. The name of the list is then entered in the “Control details” column of the Dictionary sheet.\n\nIn the case of “list_auto” variables, you only need to provide the name of another variable in the “Control details” column. In the linelist, the values present in the referred variable will be automatically used to populate the dropdown menu. See this How to for an example.\n\n\nFormulas\nIf you have selected “formula”, “choice_formula” or “case_when” in the Control column, you need to provide the formula to be applied in this column.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nThe information given in the Formula control section below are also valid for “choice_formula” and “case_when” controls as these, while based on custom functions, are still formulas.\n\n\n\nformula control\nThe formula is written in English, without an “=” sign. During compilation, the formulas will automatically be translated into the Excel language defined on the computer used to generate the linelist.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportant\n\n\n\nWhen writing a formula, make sure that it returns an empty value for rows without an ID, as all the rows with non-null values in it will be counted in the Analyses sheets. If your graphs show a lot of “Missing” values that do not reflect how well a column is filled, check that a calculated column is not responsible for it.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportant: english proof your formulas!\n\n\n\nIf your Excel is not configured to use English, pay special attention to the following:\n\nUse the English function names, such as MEAN instead of MOYENNE, or IF instead of SI.\nFunction arguments are separated by “,” in English. Beware of lingering “;” if you are used to Excel in French!\nSimilarly, English Excel uses “.” for decimals, not “,” like in French.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip: improve formual readibility\n\n\n\n\n\nIn Excel, you can use ALT+ENTRY to insert a carriage return to go to the next line. This does not affect the execution of your formulas, but greatly increases the readability. The same goes for inserting spaces around operators. Contrast these two formulas:\n\n\n\n\n\n\ncase_when control\nUse the CASE_WHEN function to replace nested IF (therefore limiting the risk of error when writing the formula), in this form:\n\nCASE_WHEN(condition1, value1,\ncondition2, value2,\ncondition3, value3,\n…, …,\nDEFAULT_VALUE)\n\nYou need at least one pair of conditions-values but the function shines when there are many pairs. As in the nested IF or in the IFS functions, the conditional statement are tested in the order they are written.\nBy default, any case that is not covered by the previous conditions will return an empty cell, unless you provide a default value (the “else”).\nExample\nYou could write a formula with nested IF to calculate an age_years column:\n\nIF(age_unit = “months”, age_value / 12, IF(age_unit = “days”, age_value / 365, IF(age_unit = “years”, age_value, IF(ISBLANK(age_unit), ““))))\n\nOr write the equivalent with CASE_WHEN:\n\nCASE_WHEN(age_unit = “months”,\nage_value / 12, age_unit = “days”,\nage_value / 365, age_unit = “years”,\nage_value)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nThe information about the more generalist “formula” control are also valid here.\n\n\n\n\nchoice_formula control\nThe CHOICE_FORMULA function is a subcase of CASE_WHEN for when we want to encode a few known modalities.\nThe pseudo-code is very similar to the CASE_WHEN function:\n\nCHOICE_FORMULA(list_values_choices,\ncondition1, value1,\ncondition2, value2,\ncondition3, value3,\n…, … )\n\nBut here, the value1, value2, value3 etc. are pre-defined in the list “list_values_choices” in the “Choices” sheet, as if these values were for a dropdown menu 5.\nSince we know exactly which modalities this variable can take, we can use it as a categorical variable in the Analyses sheet, to build a uni or a bivariate table.\nExample:\n\nCHOICE_FORMULA(list_age_group, age_years &lt; 5, “0 – 4 years”, age_years &lt; 10, “5 – 9 years, age_years &lt; 15,”10 – 14 years, age_years &lt; 20, “15 – 19 years, AND(age_years &gt;= 20, age_years &lt; 120),”20+ years” )\n\nHere, “list_age_group” corresponds to the list where the potential values to be returned are predefined; “age_years” is an existing variable that contains the age in years. The values between inverted commas (“0 – 5 years”) correspond to the possible results, predefined in “list_age_group”.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nThe information about the more generalist “formula” control are also valid here.\n\n\n\n\nExample\nHere is an example of a setup that codes for two input columns (age value and age unit) and three calculated columns.\n\nage_num is a numeric column, with no special control\nage_unit contains a dropdown with categories “Day”/“Month/”Year”\nage_years uses CASE_WHEN to transform the input data into the age in years and keeping the formula easy to read. This column is continous, and can be used in the analyses to calculate a mean or a median (or any relevant summary statistics)\nage_months is a simpler formula based on age_years.\nage_group uses CHOICE_FORMULA so this column can be used in univariate or bivariate tables to count the nomber of patients in each class, and to build an age pyramid.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUnique\nThis is a yes/no dropdown menu field. If the variable should have unique values (such as the patient ID in some cases), special data validation will be applied to duplicated values."

The Export sheet contains metadata for each export, while the “Export” columns in the Dictionary sheet allows to decide individually for each variable whether to export it or not in a given export.\nTo create a new export, first fill the Exports sheet, which will add corresponding columns to the Dictionary sheet.\n\nRules\n\nVariables with any value entered in the “Export” columns will be exported. If you want to not export a variable, you need to keep the cells empty.\nYou can define the order in which variables are displayed in exports by entering numbers in the export column. If two variables have the same number (in the same export column), they will be exported in the order they are defined in the setup (from top to bottom).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip: create anonymous exports\n\n\n\nIf you wish to create an anonymous export, i.e. one containing no personal identifier, you can filter the “personal identifier” column to yes and check that the column corresponding to the anonymous export is empty.\n\n\n\n\nExample\nIn the following example, two exports have been created. The first one exports all variables present in the order that they appear in the setup. The other export (perhaps a specific MoH export) only export some variable, and choses the order (facility_name is exported first, then facility_type, then etc.)."

For patients to appear on the map at a given resolution level, their geolocations needs to match the geobase for this level because the geobase loaded with the linelist corresponds to shapes used to create maps.\nIf a place of origin cannot be matched for a given level (e.g. health area), the patient will not be included on the map at the “health area” level resolution If the above level (here the health zone) is matched, the patient will be accounted in the health zone resolution map.\nThe patient will be counted in other tables/graphs as long as the relevant information is filled, regardless of the geomatching."

    "text": "Introduction\nOutbreak-tools is a set of tools to facilitate the creation and maintainance of Excel linelists. In particular, you can easily:\n\ndefine different types of variables (dropdown lists, Excel formulas) their format and data validation rules\nprint a register book that perfectly match your linelist. Translate your linelist into several languages\nuse pre-defined geo databases for patient origin\n\ndisplay custom analyses (univariate, bivariate, temporal, spatial) as tables and graphs\n\nexport the entire data or selected variables/lines\nmigrate the data to an updated version of the linelist\n\nThe linelist is defined in a configuration file called setup. This setup file is then loaded into another file that designs the linelist (the designer). The designer creates the linelist, based on the configurations of the setup.\nThere are 3 steps to creating a linelist:\n\nOpen the setup file and define your needs. The configuration of the file is inspired from Kobo’s XLS forms. No in-depth knowledge of Excel is required. A setup file can be used to create linelists in several languages.\nDownload geographic data for the targeted area: there is a Geo-App available online to download the geobase for the region of interest (new users must register). The Geo-App is updated as new geographical information becomes available.\nOpen the designer, load the setup and geobase files, set the options (languages etc) and generate your linelist."

These columns are often fundamental variables in the linelist, that are needed for data understanding and analyses (e.g. date of admission, age or sex). If you choose to hide one of these columns, know that some analyses might not function as expected, or not at all because they rely on the hidden columns.\nFinally, any change of column visibility that is not made via the “Hide/show variable” button of the linelist will not be recorded and migrated to a new linelist."

In this case, you can create a calculated column that gets the name of the facility from a metadata sheet so that data encoders do not have to fill the name of the health structure again and again and again:\n\nIF(ISBLANK(case_id), ““, info_facility_name)\n\nSee the page on formulas and formulas controls\n\n\nLink two tables\nA more complex situation is when you have two 2-dimensions tables that are not independent. In this case, the tables should at minima be linked by a key.\nExample of a user case:\n\na main data entry sheet with general patient data (e.g. a Patient linelist sheet)\na secondary entry sheet with additional variables for a subset of patients (e.g. readmission variables or extensive lab testing).\n\nIn this case, the natural way to link the tables is to have the ID of the patient in both tables.\n\nConstrain possibles values for patient IDs in the secondary table with list_auto\nIn the user case above, the patients from the Readmission sheet are a subset from the Patient linelist sheet so we expect the IDs from Readmission to match the ones from Patient linelist.\nThe minimal (unsafe) option is to have two free text patient ID columns, one in each table, where data encoders enter IDs manually. This process however increases the risk of typing error and thus of merging nightmare.\nA safer way is to create a categorical variable in the Readmission sheet whose dropdown menu is populated by values present in the case_id column of the Patient linelist sheet. As the data encoder can only choose from existing patients from the Patient linelist sheet, the opportunity for encoding error and thus unmatched patients is greatly reduced.3\n\n\n\nUse of list_auto to link two columns\n\n\nSeethe section on list_auto and its control for a description on how to use the list_auto control.\n\n\nImport values from the other table with VALUE_OF\nIn addition to key columns to be able to join the tables, it might be desirable to bring some of the patient data in the secondary table, to calculate new variables, or just to facilitate reading and understanding without having fill the value on each line.\nFor example, we might want to bring in the name and surname of the patient, without entering it again, or the date of exit, to be able to calculate the number of days between the exit of the first admission and the date of readmission.\nThe custom function VALUE_OF can do that. It works sort of like a LOOKUP function, except we provide variable names, and it matches the value you need.\nIt takes three arguments, all variable names:\n\nVALUE_OF(key_variable1, key_variable2, variable_values)\n\n\nkey_variable1: the list_auto in the current sheet (the key column that contains IDs, e.g. readmission_id)\n\n\nkey_variable2: the source of the list_auto in the other sheet (the IDs from the main sheet, e.g. case_id)\n\n\nvariable_values: the variable which values we want to import.\n\n\n\n\nIllustration of the use of VALLUE_OF\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWarning\n\n\n\nkey_variable2 and variable_values must be on the same sheet or the function will return nothing.\n\n\nThe function matches the values from columns key_variable1 and key_variable2, and returns values from variable_values column at the corresponding row.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nIf the function finds more than two matches, it will return the values from the first match (the first line found)."

But you can add more when these are filled. Click on the “Add Rows” button to add 200 new empty rows.\n\n\nResize table\nYou can resize the table to remove empty rows at the bottom of the table on the linelist sheet. Click on the “Resize table” button to remove any empty row.\n\n\nClear all filters\nTo remove all the filters at once, click on the “Clear all filters” button. This is useful if you applied filters to several columns scattered left and right of the table and want to reverse to the full view without missing a sneaky filter somewhere.\n\n\nSort the variable\nIf you need to visualize your data by sorting on specific variables (date of notification for example), you need to use the sorting function. Place the cursor in a cell of the column you want to sort (from line 9) and click on the button.\nThe first time you click, you have a message to confirm the action, once you click yes, you cannot undo it. The first time it sorts by ascending order, if you click again, it will sort by descending order.\n\n\nWeek start\nChose the day that starts the week in your country using the “Week start” button. The selected value will be applied to the whole linelist (calculated epiweeks, as well as in the analyses).\nWhen you click on the button, a pop up window appears, where you can select the day of the week. Then close the window.\n\n\nAutofit columns\nUse this button to improve column width so that the columns take less space. The fit takes into account the label, the length of categories of the variable (if any) and the name of the variable (hidden).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nYou can manually modify the width of columns in the linelist table to adjust to content the way you would do in any Excel file.\n\n\n\n\nGeoHelper\nThe GeoHelper is a popup window that helps you entering geographic data such as the origin of the patient or the name of the facility (if the “hf” control was used for the variable). It is mostly used to enter data on the patient data sheet, but it is also useful on the Spatio-Temporal analysis sheet.\nTo use it, place your cursor in a “geo” or “hf” column (you can recognise them thanks to the orange headers), in the admin 1 level. Click on the “GeoHelper” button, or hit the shortcut Ctrl + Shift + G. It opens a window, with several tabs, depending on whether you are in a “geo” (described by four visible columns) or in “hf” (described by one visible column).\nIf you are in a “geo” section, you will have three tabs that you can use to select administrative levels.\n\nCascade: select the admin levels with cascading menus, by selecting one admin level after the other, starting from the highest one.\nSearch: search by typing the name (needs at least 3 letters)\nHistory: quickly find a previous entry entered through the GeoHelper (does not work for data entered using the regular cascading dropdowns).\n\nOnce the location has been found, select it and click on “OK”."

There are also options to include metadata on the state of hidden/shown columns (to not have to redo the full setup in the new file), and the updated labels of the custom variables, if you used these variables.\n\n\n\nExport for migration\n\n\nAfter selecting the options and clicking on “Export”, a window pops-up for saving the export. Select the folder and click on “OK”. Once finished a message appears to ask if you want to close the window.\nThe export creates three files:\n\na file containing the data and all sort of metadata\na file containing the geobase that is currently in the linelist, as well as the history from the GeoHelper\na file containing only the GeoHelper history (in case you want to upgrade to a new version of the geobase but wished to keep your GeoHelper history)\n\n\n\nImport geobase history\nThis button allows you to import a file containing the history of the geobase (such a file was created by exporting the data from migration, see above).\n\n\nLast Import Report\nThe button allows you to display the report from the last import made.\n\n\nDelete data or geobase history\nThis are a dangerous buttons that allows you to delete data or geobase history from the linelist.\n“Delete all data” allows you to remove all the data you entered from the workbook. After clicking, you will have a warning message. To confirm the deletion, you will need to enter the full name of the file.\n“Delete geobase history” allows you to empty the table with the geobase history so the list of suggestion of the history method from the GeoHelper will be empty.\n\n\nRestore the state of hidden columns\nThis button allows you to restore the state of hidden columns (i.e. hide them all again) if, for any reasons these columns had been shown.\nNote that hidden columns are not supposed to be shown, and the user can thus not modify their visibility state from the regular Show/Hide variables button, hence this button."
